# libraryCase-universityProject-2017
Project designed to store and manage users, books and loans of a library. 
It is heavely focused on database, its optimization and DAL as well as testing. 


-Testing
  Testing represented one of the primary focuses during development - it was one of the university subjects this project was based upon.
  The project report file (in the About folder) describes in details, how the test master test plan for this project looks like, 
  what testing strategy was chosen and followed, what types of tests were performed and how the tests were implemented.
  
-Database
  Another key factor for this project was database and relational database SQL Server was picked to do the job. Once again,
  the report file catches the whole process, from designing the Entity relationship diagram, converting it to Relational database schema,
  normilizing it to BCNF to database implementation. A series of steps were performed in order to improve database performance, 
  from query optimization via query trees to performance analisys and execution plan analysis.
